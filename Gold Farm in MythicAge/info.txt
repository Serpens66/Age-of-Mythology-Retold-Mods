(Additive Mod)
- allows to transform Farms to Gold-Farms in mythic age (Farm UI) with low gatherrate.
- meant as an lategame alternative to gather gold save in your base but with lower gatherrate.
- is not affected by any economic upgrades

Known Issue:
- does not display costs, but on every transform it reduces the buildcosts of the farm.
- the tooltip from PeachBlossom is used, which says it automatically produces resources, but its normal farm behaviour (too lazy to create a new string for every language).
