(Additive Mod)
- SkyPassage: Allows allied units to garrision
- Makes the UnderWorldPassage work like the SkyPassage. So you can garrision units in it and release them on any other UnderWorldPassage.
- Allows to recruit up to 10 Hades-Shades per Passage without poplimit at the UnderWorldPassage (to guard it, they are stronger near the Passage)
- Increased hitpoints from the UnderWorldPassage a bit and made it repairable.
- Therefore changes the costs and cooldown from the UnderWorldPassage-godpower to: 90 seconds. First 2 times free and every other +100 favor.

Attention:
- Works in new games and in savegames where you did not yet reached the HeroicAgeApollo.
- AI can most likely not use the new UnderworldPassage and no clue how to additive mod the AI files..
