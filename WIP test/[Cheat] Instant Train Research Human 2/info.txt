(Additive Mod)
- Adds a toggle-tech to the towncenter to enable/disable "instant train units" and "instant researches".
- Was made with such a tech instead of directly applying, because AI does not research techs added by mods -> AI will not have instant train/research.

Compatibility:
Is incompatible with mods/game updates putting sth. else at the very same UI location in the TownCenter (row="2" column="3").
