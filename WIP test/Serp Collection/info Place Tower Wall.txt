(Additive Mod)
- Allows you to place a SentryTower on top of single walls (WallConnector)
- removes the building restriction of walls (could not be placed too near to TownCenters and Goldmines)

(I was not able to update my not good working previous version "Wall To Tower", so this is a new upload with much better solution)
