(Additive Mod)
- Collection of mods made by me (Serp66) that I personally always use for playing skirmish.
- This way I don't have to activate a dozen small single mods, but only one. 
- Do NOT activate any mod included in this collection at the same time like the collection, it may conflict!
- I also made other mods which are not included (you can search for "Serp" in the modbrowser)
- I may add/remove/change mods based on my own liking.

Included Mods:
- AreaHeal TownCenter
- AutoScout Military
- Buildings Hitpoints x2 (compatible)
- Citadel in WonderAge
- Delete Icon Skull
- Free Relic on AgeUp
- MirrorTower for All MythUnit
- No Formation
- Place Tower On Wall
- Respawn Resources
- RevealUI Vision Spy Obelisk
