(Additive Mod)
- Adds a new button to all Military Units to disable/enable formation (for all your MilitaryUnit, not only the selected!).
- Use this if you do not want your units to walk in any formation, especially not waiting for slower units.

Attention:
While your units are already moving, they can not stop the formation. Disabling formation only takes effect after they stood still.

Should work for every MilitaryUnit even ones added by mods/game updates.
