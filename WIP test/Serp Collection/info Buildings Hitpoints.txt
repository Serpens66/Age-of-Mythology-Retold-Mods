(Additive Mod)
- multiplies the hitpoints and damage from AbstractTownCenter and AbstractFortress with 3 and slightly increases Hack armor.
- multiplies the hitpoints from AbstractTower and AbstractWall with 2 and slightly increases Hack armor.
- doubles the buildlimit for AbstractTower and *1.5 the buildlimit from AbstractFortress.

- this mod should work for every other building of these kinds added by game updates or mods, even from new civs. No need to update the mod.
- it does not hardcode new values, but increases the current ones, so can also be combined with other mods changing these values.
