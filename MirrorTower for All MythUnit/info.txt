(Additive Mod)
- Buffs the Mirror Tower: It makes Divine damage now (not blocked by armor), has a multiplier against Myth Units, has a chain attack and is affected by most techs which affect Sentry Towers (has a bit weaker stats than vanilla without those upgrades)
- makes it available to build for all civs in Heroic Age (within UI from Sentry Tower!)
- Helios can build a bit more towers, with a bit higher range and hitpoints as compensation.
- To make AI also use it (can not additive edit AI behaviour), the AI will autobuild one next to each TownCenter/Fortress.

Should work for every civ which can build the SentryTower, even ones added by mods or game updates.
Is only incompatible to mods/updates adding buttons in the second line of SentryTower.
