1.01:
- fixed critical bug which made nearly endless strange problems: Was caused just because maxrange of an action was 0, which is not allowed by the game.
1.02:
- made code more compatible, eg. to my new mod SkyPassage for Everyone
1.03:
- moved the buttons in sentry tower one line down (3rd line), because some gods have their mythic upgrades at second line
1.04:
- made the Build-Button appear from begin of the game with tooltip to reach heroic age.
- the AI will autobuild a mirror tower next to each TownCenter/Fortress.
