(Additive Mod)
- All heroes regenerate 1.5 health per second (overwrites any vanilla value via tech, so for some its an upgrade from 0 or 1, for others a downgrade from 2)
- researching "Heroic Renewal" tech from Atlantean adds 1.5 health/s on top.

Should work on every hero unit, regardless if from a mod, campaign or game update, since it is applied via a tech for everyone as soon as the game is started.
