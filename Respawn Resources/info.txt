(Additive Mod)
- Makes most resource sources renewable:
 - goldmines regenerate 1 gold per second (also over the maximum unfortunately)
 - animals and trees respawn after 20 minutes if the stump/marker was not overbuilt.
 - You can prevent respawning by placing any construction site on top of the stumps/markers (animals have tiny animals as respawn marker)

Unlike most of my other mods, this time it was not possible to make this mod also compatible for all trees/animals/goldmines that may be added by mods/game updates.
 So it only works for the ones currently existing in the game as of 30.09.2024
 Needs an update to support new kind of trees/animals.

If you want to report bugs, write to User "serp66" in the official "Age of Empires" discord channel.
(there you can also request updates to the mod. If I do not respond within 1 month, feel free to upload an updated version yourself)
