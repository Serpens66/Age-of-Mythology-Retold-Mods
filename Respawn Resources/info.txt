(Additive Mod)
- Makes most resource sources renewable:
 - goldmines regenerate 1 gold per second (also over the maximum unfortunately)
 - animals and trees and berrybushes respawn after 20 minutes if the stump/marker was not overbuilt.
 - You can prevent respawning by placing any construction site on top of the stumps/markers (animals have tiny animals as respawn marker)

Unlike most of my other mods, this time it was not possible to make this mod also compatible for all trees/animals/goldmines that may be added by mods/game updates.
 So it only works for the ones currently existing in the game as of 20.10.2025
 Needs an update to support new kind of trees/animals.
Also incompatible to mods/updates which add a tactics file to the goldmines (but can be made compatible to such udpates).

If you want to report bugs, write to User "serp66" in the official "Age of Empires" discord channel.
(there you can also request updates to the mod. If I do not respond within 1 month, feel free to upload an updated version yourself)
