(Additive Mod)
- Allows building up to 2 low health Sky Passages for every civ (construction placeable within UI from Sentry Tower!)
- allow allied units to be garrisoned in any Sky Passage.

Should work for every civ which can build the SentryTower, even ones added by mods or game updates.
Is only incompatible to mods/updates adding buttons in the second line of SentryTower at the same position.
