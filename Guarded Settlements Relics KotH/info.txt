(Additive Mod)
- Relics, Settlements and KingOfTheHill Treasury are guarded by slowly respawning mythic units fitting to the highest age and map (80%) or random ones (20% or if map type can not be detected, based on trees).
- Especially Norse players will profit from this, since they can fight for favor without attacking a player.
- Settle the settlements or destroy the flags near relics/KotH to stop the spawning.
- AI might have a little more trouble, since it sends single villagers/heroes to settlements/relics and losses the first small armies, but after a few attempts it usually defeats them.
- Do not choose a too small map, otherwise it might happen they can attack your start settlement.
