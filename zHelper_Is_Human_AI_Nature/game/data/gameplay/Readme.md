This mod contains my code for data modding to find out if the executing player is:
- Human
- AI
- Nature

In theory it should work find if you simply compy paste of of this code into your mod, without any changes. At best test if this works and is still compatible to my mods doing the same.  
But in case I do any changes/fixes to my code, your mod might still use outdated code which could break also my newer code, so maybe it might be better to instead change the name of everything from "_Serp" to your nickname and check my code from time to time for updates.
