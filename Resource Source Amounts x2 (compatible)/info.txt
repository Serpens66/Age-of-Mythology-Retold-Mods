(Additive Mod)
- doubles the resource amount from all resource sources (unittype=Resource)

The code is written in a way, that it should also affects all resource sources added by game updates or other mods, so no update should be needed.
And it does not hardcode a fixed value, it multiplies them, so it can stack if you use other mods modifying it.

Known issues:
- when loading a savegame where this mod was not yet active in, most resources will show their progress bar forever. But this is no problem for new games.
